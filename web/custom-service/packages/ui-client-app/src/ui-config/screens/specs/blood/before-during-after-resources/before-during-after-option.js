Most whole blood donations are spun in centrifuges to separate it into transfusable components: red cells, platelets, and plasma.`,`
Plasma may be processed into components such as cryoprecipitate, which helps control the risk of bleeding by helping blood to clot.`,`
Red cells and platelets are leuko-reduced, which means your white cells are removed in order to reduce the possibility of the recipient having a reaction to the transfusion.`,`
Each component is packaged as a “unit,” a standardized amount that doctors will use when transfusing a patient.`
