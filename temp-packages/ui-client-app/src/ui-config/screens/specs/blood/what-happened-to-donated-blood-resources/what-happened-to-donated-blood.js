Your donation, test tubes and your donor record are labeled with an identical bar code label.`,

Your donation is kept on ice before being taken to a Red Cross center for processing; the test tubes go to the lab.`

      `At our processing center, information about your donation is scanned into a computer database.`,`
Most whole blood donations are spun in centrifuges to separate it into transfusable components: red cells, platelets, and plasma.`,`
Plasma may be processed into components such as cryoprecipitate, which helps control the risk of bleeding by helping blood to clot.`,`
Red cells and platelets are leuko-reduced, which means your white cells are removed in order to reduce the possibility of the recipient having a reaction to the transfusion.`,`
Each component is packaged as a “unit,” a standardized amount that doctors will use when transfusing a patient.`

A dozen tests are performed, to establish the blood type and test for infectious diseases. Learn More About Tests Performed.`,`

If a test result is positive, your donation will be discarded and you will be notified (our test results are confidential and are only shared with the donor, except as may be required by law).`

Physicians determine whether the patient requires a transfusion and, if so, which type.`,`
Blood transfusions are given to patients in a wide range of circumstances, including serious injuries (such as in a car crash) surgeries, child birth, anemia, blood disorders, cancer treatments, and many others. See How Blood Donations Help.`,`
A patient suffering from an iron deficiency or anemia may receive red blood cells to increase their hemoglobin and iron levels, improving the amount of oxygen in the body.`,`
Patients who are unable to make enough platelets, due to illness or chemotherapy, may receive platelet transfusions to stay healthy.`,`
Plasma transfusions are used for patients with liver failure, severe infections, and serious burns.`
